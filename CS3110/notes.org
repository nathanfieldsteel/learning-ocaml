* Learning OCaml - Notes

My notes file for learning OCaml and for working through the CS3110 book.

** Goals for this document
+ Learning OCaml
+ Working through the CS3110 book.
+ Learn something about literate programming in org-mode
** Remarks on OCaml in org-mode

You can use ~C-c C-,~ to open the export block dialog, select ~s~ for
source and type ocaml. lets you type ocaml code with syntax
highlighting and indentation from ~merlin~ in the org buffer. In a
source block, ~C-c C-c~ runs the code and puts the results of
evaluation underneath the source block.

In the event these source blocks aren't adequate, ~M-x
tuareg-run-ocaml~ opens the actual ocaml toplevel that emacs is
running in the background.

The following variables control something about the way code gets
passed to and retrieved from the ocaml toplevel that emacs runs in the
background. If you end up actually opening and using the toplevel
directly in order to check or debug code, it can end up looking a
little cluttered with this expression repeated all over the place, so
it might be worth it to change it to a smaller or simpler expression
in that case. I haven't dound this to be necessary.

#+begin_example emacs-lisp
  (setq org-babel-ocaml-eoe-output "org-babel-ocaml-eoe")
  (setq org-babel-ocaml-eoe-indicator "\"org-babel-ocaml-eoe\";;")
#+end_example

The default behavior of source blocks may not be adequate for printing
results. For example the following source block shows its result, but
does not show that the result has type ~int~

#+begin_src ocaml
    let x = 42;;
    x
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 42

But if we pass the header argument to insist that the result is
displayed verbatim, then we see the type as well.

#+begin_src ocaml :results verbatim
    let x = 42;;
    x
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: - : int = 42

This can also be an issue with multi-line output. The default seems to
be that only the last line of toplevel output makes it back to the org
buffer, so this source block would juss show ~unit = ()~. Again, the
verbatim tag fixes this. ~:results output~ is another option, similar
to ~verbatim~.

#+begin_src ocaml :export code
  print_string "hello\n"
#+end_src

For the purpose of exporting the entire org file to pdf by way of
latex, we need to do a bit of extra work. We want to wrap source
blocks in the ~minted~ latex environment so they can be colored and
syntax-highlighted by ~pygments~. For visual clarity in the final pdf,
we also want the output to be ocaml source blocks. But these output
blocks should not be evaluated.

So we want source blocks with ~export~ set to ~both~, with ~results~
set to ~verbatim~ and ~wrapped~ in an ocaml source block, and where
the results blocks have their ~export~ set to just ~code~. The best
way I've found to do this is by setting

#+begin_example
#+PROPERTY: header-args:ocaml :exports both :results verbatim :wrap "src ocaml :exports code"
#+end_example

at the top of the org file. Additionally, since so many ocaml
functions have underscores in their names, we want to set ~#+OPTIONS:
^:nil~ at the top of the file. Otherwise tex will interpret these as
subscripts.

*** TODO org latex export

These is still something strange going on with org's export. If I
export from notes.org in an empty directory, source blocks don't make
it to the final pdf document, though they look right in the latex
source. Then if I run ~pdflatex -shell-escape notes.tex~ on my own,
a pdf is produced that does show the source (and output) blocks
correctly. After that, org export will start working as expected. I
don't know why this is happening but for now it's not worth the
headache to fix it. Exporting the pdf shouldn't happen often enough
for it to be a real problem.

Also, need to change this variable to ~nil~

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
#+end_src

before exporting in order to avoid needing to type "yes" for every
single source block. Probably should try to incorporate this into
emacs configuration, but in a safe way.

*** 2.9 Basics - Exercises [16/16]
**** DONE Values $[\star]$

What is the type and value of each of the following OCaml expressions:

+ ~7 * (1 + 2 + 3)~

This is ~42~, an ~int~.

#+begin_src ocaml :results verbatim :export both
  7 * (1 + 2 + 3)
#+end_src

+ ~"CS " ^ string_of_int 3110~

This is ~"CS 3110"~ , a ~string.~

#+begin_src ocaml
  "CS " ^ string_of_int 3110
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : string = "CS 3110"
#+end_src

**** DONE Operators $[\star\star]$

+ Write an expression that multiplies 42 by 10

#+begin_src ocaml
  42 * 10
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : int = 420
#+end_src

+ Write an expression that divides 3.14 by 2.0

#+begin_src ocaml
  3.14 /. 2.0
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : float = 1.57
#+end_src

+ Write an expression that computes 4.2 raised to the 7th power

#+begin_src ocaml
  let rec pow a b = match b with
    | 0 -> 1.0
    | b -> a *. pow a (b-1) in
      pow 4.2 7
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : float = 23053.9333248000075
#+end_src

**** DONE Equality $[\star]$

+ Write an expression that compares ~42~~ to ~42~ using structural
  equality

Structural equality is compared with ~=~ (or ~<>~ for inequality)

#+begin_src ocaml
  42 = 42
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : bool = true
#+end_src

+ Write an expression that compares ~"hi"~ to ~"hi"~ using structural
  equality. What is the result?

#+begin_src ocaml
  "hi" = "hi"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : bool = true
#+end_src
  
+ Write an expression that compares ~"hi"~ to ~"hi"~ using physical
  equality. What is the result?

Physical equality is compared with ~==~ and ~!=~.

#+begin_src ocaml
  "hi" == "hi"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : bool = false
#+end_src

structural equality is closer to the mathematical notion of equality,
but physical equality is closer to "are these the same object in
memory?". Seems like for my purposes it's usually correct to use ~=~.

**** DONE Assertions $[\star]$

+ Enter ~assert true;;~ into utop and see what happens.

~assert true;;~ seems to do "nothing" with type unit.

+ Enter ~assert false;;~ into utop and see what happens.

Assert false throws an exception, ~Assert_failure~

+ Write an expression that asserts 2110 is not (structurally) equal
  to 3110.

#+begin_src ocaml
  assert (2110 <> 3110);;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : unit = ()
#+end_src

**** DONE If $[\star]$

Write an if expression that evaluates to 42 if 2 is greater than 1 and
otherwise evaluates to 7.

#+begin_src ocaml
  if 2 > 1 then 42 else 7;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : int = 42
#+end_src

**** DONE Double fun $[\star]$

Using the increment function from above as a guide, define a function
double that multiplies its input by 2. For example, double 7 would
be 14. Test your function by applying it to a few inputs. Turn those
test cases into assertions.

#+begin_src ocaml
  let double x = 2 * x;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val double : int -> int = <fun>
#+end_src

To test it, double some small integers.

#+begin_src ocaml
  List.map double [-1;0;1;2;3]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : int list = [-2; 0; 2; 4; 6]
#+end_src

Using assertions:

#+begin_src ocaml
  assert (double 0 = 0);;
  assert (double 10 = 20);;
  assert (double 50 = 100);;
  assert (double 2 = 4);;
  assert (double 3 <> 5);;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : unit = ()
#+end_src

**** DONE More fun $[\star\star]$

+ Define a function that computes the cube of a floating-point
  number. Test your function by applying it to a few inputs.

#+begin_src ocaml
  let cube x = x *. x *. x;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val cube : float -> float = <fun>
#+end_src

Test on some small floats

#+begin_src ocaml
  List.map cube [-1.; 0.0; 1.; 1.5; 2.]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : float list = [-1.; 0.; 1.; 3.375; 8.]
#+end_src

+ Define a function that computes the sign (1, 0, or -1) of an
  integer. Use a nested if expression. Test your function by applying
  it to a few inputs.

As much as I'd prefer to use a ~match~ expression, they said use nested
~if~ expressions:

#+begin_src ocaml
  let sign x = if x < 0
               then -1
               else (if x > 0
                     then 1
                     else 0)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val sign : int -> int = <fun>
#+end_src

Test a little:

#+begin_src ocaml
List.map sign [-2;-1;0;1;2;3]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : int list = [-1; -1; 0; 1; 1; 1]
#+end_src

+ Define a function that computes the area of a circle given its
  radius. Test your function with assert.

#+begin_src ocaml
  let area r =
    let pi = Float.pi in
    pi *. r *. r;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val area : float -> float = <fun>
#+end_src

Quick ~assert~ test. Could do more.

#+begin_src ocaml
  assert (area 1.0 -. Float.pi < 1e-5)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : unit = ()
#+end_src

**** DONE RMS $[\star\star]$

Define a function that computes the root mean square of two
numbers—i.e. $$\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$ Test your function with assert.

#+begin_src ocaml
  let rms x y = Float.sqrt(x *. x +. y *. y);;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val rms : float -> float -> float = <fun>
#+end_src

Testing it by generating Pythagorean triples:

#+begin_src ocaml
  let rmstest s t =
    let a = 2. *. s *. t in
    let b = s *. s -. t *. t in
    let c = s *. s +. t *. t in
    assert (rms a b -. c < 1e-8);;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val rmstest : float -> float -> unit = <fun>
#+end_src

#+begin_src ocaml
  [rmstest 10. 21.; rmstest 1000. 3201.;]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : unit list = [(); ()]
#+end_src

**** DONE date fun $[\star\star\star]$

Define a function that takes an integer ~d~ and string ~m~ as input and returns ~true~ just when ~d~ and ~m~ form a valid date. Here, a valid date has a month that is one of the following abbreviations: ~Jan~, ~Feb~, ~Mar~, ~Apr~, ~May~, ~Jun~, ~Jul~, ~Aug~, ~Sept~, ~Oct~, ~Nov~, ~Dec~. And the day must be a number that is between ~1~ and the minimum number of days in that month, inclusive. For example, if the month is ~Jan~, then the day is between ~1~ and ~31~, inclusive, whereas if the month is ~Feb~, then the day is between ~1~ and ~28~, inclusive.

How terse (i.e., few and short lines of code) can you make your
function? You can definitely do this in fewer than 12 lines.

(it's not clear to me why this is a "three star" exercise. Am I
supposed to to this with a hash table or something? Six lines is fewer
than 12, but is this not terse enough?)

#+begin_src ocaml
  let valid_date d m =
    match d with
    | "Feb" -> m <= 28
    | "Sept" | "Apr" | "Jun" | "Nov" -> m <= 30
    | "Jan" | "Mar" | "May" | "Jul" | "Aug" | "Oct" | "Dec" -> m <= 31
    | _ -> false;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val valid_date : string -> int -> bool = <fun>
#+end_src

Little test

#+begin_src ocaml
  valid_date "Apr" 20
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : bool = true
#+end_src

**** DONE fib $[\star\star]$

Define a recursive function ~fib : int -> int~, such that ~fib n~ is
the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence, which is ~1~, ~1~, ~2~, ~3~, ~5~, ~8~,
~13~, … That is

+ ~fib 1 = 1~
+ ~fib 2 = 1~
+ ~fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)~ for ~n > 2~

#+begin_src ocaml
  let rec fib n = match n with
    | 1 | 2 -> 1
    | n -> fib (n-1) + fib (n-2);;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val fib : int -> int = <fun>
#+end_src

Test small values:

#+begin_src ocaml
  List.map fib [1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : int list = [1; 1; 2; 3; 5; 8; 13; 21; 34; 55]
#+end_src

Looks right to me.

**** DONE fib fast $[\star\star*]$

How quickly does your implementation of fib compute the 50th Fibonacci
number? If it computes nearly instantaneously, congratulations! But
the recursive solution most people come up with at first will seem to
hang indefinitely. The problem is that the obvious solution computes
subproblems repeatedly. For example, computing fib 5 requires
computing both fib 3 and fib 4, and if those are computed separately,
a lot of work (an exponential amount, in fact) is being redone.

Here's my code to time the computation of ~fib n~.

#+begin_src ocaml :export code 
  let fibtimer n = 
    let t1 = Sys.time() in
    let fn = fib n in
    let t2 = Sys.time() in
    let output = "found fib "
                 ^ (string_of_int n)
                 ^ " = "
                 ^ (string_of_int fn)
                 ^ " in "
                 ^ (string_of_float (t2 -. t1))
                 ^ " seconds." in
    print_endline output;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val fibtimer : int -> unit = <fun>
#+end_src

Running ~fibtimer 50;;~ will print ~found fib 50 = 12586269025 in
257.446328 seconds~. So indeed, it's Slow.

Here's a faster version (can probably do slighly better by writing the
linear recurrence as the product of a power of a $2 \times 2$ matrix
times a vector, but thats' a lot of work for minimal gain.

#+begin_src ocaml
  let fib_fast n =
    let rec fib_aux a b n = match n with
      | 1 -> a
      | n -> fib_aux b (a+b) (n-1) in
    fib_aux 1 1 n;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val fib_fast : int -> int = <fun>
#+end_src

Again, here's a time:

#+begin_src ocaml
  let fibfasttimer n = 
    let t1 = Sys.time() in
    let fn = fib_fast n in
    let t2 = Sys.time() in
    let output = "found fib_fast "
                 ^ (string_of_int n)
                 ^ " = "
                 ^ (string_of_int fn)
                 ^ " in "
                 ^ (string_of_float (t2 -. t1))
                 ^ " seconds." in
    print_endline output;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val fibfasttimer : int -> unit = <fun>
#+end_src

Now, running ~fibfasttimer 50~ will print ~found fib_fast 50 =
12586269025 in 4.99999998738e-06 seconds.~, which is much faster.

What is the first value of n for which ~fib_fast n~ is negative,
indicating that integer overflow occurred?

#+begin_src ocaml
  let first_overflow =
    let rec next_neg_fib n =
      if (fib_fast n < 0) then (n) else (next_neg_fib (n+1)) in
    next_neg_fib 1
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val first_overflow : int = 91
#+end_src

**** DONE poly types $[\star\star\star]$

What is the type of each of the functions below? You can ask the
toplevel to check your answers

+ ~let f x = if x then x else x~

Since ~x~ is being passed as the first argument to the ternary
if-then-else, ~x~ has to have type ~bool~. Since the output is always ~x~,
the output of ~f~ will have type ~bool~. So ~f~ is a function ~bool ->
bool~.

#+begin_src ocaml
  let f x = if x then x else x
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val f : bool -> bool = <fun>
#+end_src

+ ~let g x y = if y then x else x~

Here, ~y~ needs to have type ~bool~. But ~x~ can have arbitrary type
~T~. The output of the function will have the same type as ~x~ (in
fact, the output will be ~x~), so ~g~ is a function that takes an
argument of type ~T~ and an argument of type bool and returns an
output of type ~T~. i.e. ~g: T -> bool -> T~. Ocaml uses ~'a~ for this
type variable.

#+begin_src ocaml
  let g x y = if y then x else x
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val g : 'a -> bool -> 'a = <fun>
#+end_src

+ ~let h x y z = if x then y else z~

Again, ~x~ needs to have type ~bool~. Since the ~then~ and ~else~
branches needs to have the same output type, ~y~ and ~z~ need to have
the same arbitrary type ~T~. So ~h : bool -> T -> T -> T~

#+begin_src ocaml
  let h x y z = if x then y else z
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val h : bool -> 'a -> 'a -> 'a = <fun>
#+end_src

+ ~let i x y z = if x then y else y~

~let i x y z = if x then y else y~: Here, ~x~ need to have type
~bool~. ~y~ can have arbitrary type ~T1~, and ~z~ can have arbitrary
type ~T2~. The output is always ~y~, which will have type ~T1~. So ~i:
bool -> T1 -> T2 -> T1~. OCaml will use ~'a~ and ~'b~ to represent
these two arbitrary types.

#+begin_src ocaml
  let i x y z = if x then y else y
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val i : bool -> 'a -> 'b -> 'a = <fun>
#+end_src

**** DONE Divide $[\star\star]$

Write a function ~divide : numerator:float -> denominator:float
->float~. Apply your function.

#+begin_src ocaml
  let divide num denom =
    let q = num /. denom in
    match q with
    | q when q = infinity -> raise Division_by_zero
    | q when q = neg_infinity -> raise Division_by_zero
    | q when compare q nan = 0 -> raise Division_by_zero
    | q -> q;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val divide : float -> float -> float = <fun>
#+end_src

(weirdly, ~nan = nan~ is false, so you need to use ~compare~ in that
case)

#+begin_src ocaml
  [divide 1.0 2.0; divide 1.0 4.0; divide 10.0 5.0]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : float list = [0.5; 0.25; 2.]
#+end_src

**** DONE Associativity $[\star\star]$

Suppose that we have defined ~let add x y = x + y~. Which of the
following produces an integer, which produces a function, and which
produces an error? Decide on an answer, then check your answer in the
toplevel.

#+begin_src ocaml
  let add x y = x + y
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val add : int -> int -> int = <fun>
#+end_src

+ ~add 5 1~

This is ~add~ applied to two arguments. It evaluates to ~~5+1 = 6~. 

#+begin_src ocaml
  add 5 1
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : int = 6
#+end_src

+ ~add 5~

This is ~add~ applied to one argument. It is the "add five" function,
with type ~int -> int~.

#+begin_src ocaml
  add 5
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : int -> int = <fun>
#+end_src

+ ~(add 5) 1~

This is the "add five" function, appled to ~1~. It evaluates to ~5+1 =
6~.

#+begin_src ocaml
  (add 5) 1
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : int = 6
#+end_src

+ ~add (5 1)~

This is a syntax error. ~add~ is expecting a space-delimited list of
two or fewer integers. The token ~(5 1)~ doesn't fit the bill. In
fact, just ~(5 1)~ by itself will produce an error, since ~5~ is not a
function, so it can't be applied to ~1~.

**** DONE Average $[\star\star]$

Define an infix operator ~+/.~ to compute the average of two
floating-point numbers. For example,

+ ~1.0 +/. 2.0 = 1.5~
+ ~0. +/. 0. = 0.~
  
#+begin_src ocaml
  let (+/.) a b = (a +. b) /. 2.;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val ( +/. ) : float -> float -> float = <fun>
#+end_src

#+begin_src ocaml
  [1.0 +/. 2.0; 0. +/. 0.; 100. +/. 50.]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : float list = [1.5; 0.; 75.]
#+end_src
  
**** DONE Hello World $[\star]$

Type the following in utop, and notice the difference in output from
each:

+ ~print_endline "Hello world!";;~

This prints the given string, with a carriage return at the end. It
has type ~unit~.

#+begin_example
  Hello world!
  - : unit = ()
#+end_example
  
+ ~print_string "Hello world!";;~

Prints the string with no newline. Also has type unit. The output
looks like this:

#+begin_example
  Hello world!- : unit = ()
#+end_example

*** 3.14 Data and Types - Exercises [21/32]
**** DONE List Expressions $[\star]$

+ Construct a list that has the integers 1 through 5 in it. Use the
  square bracket notation for lists.
  
#+begin_src ocaml
  let l1 = [1;2;3;4;5];;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val l1 : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
#+end_src
  
+ Construct the same list, but do not use the square bracket

val l2 : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
#+end_src

+ Construct the same list again. This time, the following expression
  must appear in your answer: ~[2; 3; 4]~. Use the @ operator, and do

#+begin_src ocaml
  let l3 = [1] @ [2;3;4] @ [5];;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val l3 : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
#+end_src

**** DONE Product $[\star\star]$

Write a function that returns the product of all the elements in a
list. The product of all the elements of an empty list is ~1~.

#+begin_src ocaml
  let list_product l =
    let rec list_product_acc p l = match l with
      | [] -> p
      | x :: xs -> list_product_acc (p*x) xs in
    list_product_acc 1 l;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val list_product : int list -> int = <fun>
#+end_src

Small test

#+begin_src ocaml
  list_product [1;2;3;4;5;6]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : int = 720
#+end_src

**** DONE concat [**]

Write a function that concatenates all the strings in a list. The
concatenation of all the strings in an empty list is the empty string
"".

#+begin_src ocaml
    let list_concat l =
      let rec list_concat_acc s l = match l with
        | [] -> s
        | x :: xs -> list_concat_acc (s^x) xs in
      list_concat_acc "" l;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val list_concat : string list -> string = <fun>
#+end_src

Small test

#+begin_src ocaml
  list_concat ["Hel"; "lo"; ","; " ";"world";"!"]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : string = "Hello, world!"
#+end_src

**** DONE product test [**]

I had trouble following the instructions in the CS3110 book. Following
section 3.3.1, In a new directory, I created a file ~sum.ml~
containing

#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
let rec sum = function
  | [] -> 0
  | x :: xs -> x + sum xs
#+end_src

A file ~test.ml~ containing

#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
open OUnit2
open Sum

let tests = "test suite for sum" >::: [
  "empty" >:: (fun _ -> assert_equal 0 (sum []));
  "singleton" >:: (fun _ -> assert_equal 1 (sum [1]));
  "two_elements" >:: (fun _ -> assert_equal 3 (sum [1; 2]));
]

let _ = run_test_tt_main tests
#+end_src

and a file ~dune~ containing

#+begin_example
(executable
 (name test)
 (libraries ounit2))
#+end_example

Now, running ~dune build test.exe~ throws an error: "Error: I cannot
find the root of the current workspace/project." There was also a lot
of complaining about the lack of a ~dune-project~ file. I followed
dune's suggestion to create one via ~dune init proj sum~, but the
complaints about the root continued. Doing ~dune build test.exe --root
.~ seemed to work. It complained about not finding ~ounit2~, but after
doing ~opam install ounit2~, that complaint went away. Still, my
feeling is that I'm not doing this right. Probably the best thing to
do is learn how to start the whole project through dune, put the code
to be tested and the tests in the correct locations, and do things
that way.

But at this point it does seem like ~dune build test.exe --root .~
succeeds (with a persistent warning about the lack of a ~dune-project~
file), and then ~dune exec ./test.exe --root .~ runs the tests. Dune says:

#+begin_example
Ran: 3 tests in: 0.11 seconds.
OK
#+end_example

I'd like to know how to start from an empty directory, and do ~dune
init proj <name>~ to create an entire new dune project. Then fill that
project with the relevant code to be tested, the relevant tests, and
run those tests all within dune. But I can't seem to make that
work. Dune's documentation is just a little too sparse for me to
figure it out on my own.

I think the lack of a ~dune-project~ file can also be fixed by
creating an approrpiate ~dune-project file~. I seem to have a workflow
that works and "fixes" (suppresses) the above errors and warnings, and
for purposes of reproducibility, I'll try to make it clear what I did
for this problem.

In a new directory (~/standalone/product test~ directory), create the following files:

The ~product~ function to be tested is in the file ~product.ml~ 

#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
  let product lst =
    let rec product_acc p l = match l with
      | [] -> p
      | x :: xs -> product_acc (x * p) xs in
    product_acc 1 lst
#+end_src

The test suite is in ~test.ml~

#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
  open OUnit2
  open Product

  let tests = "test suite for product" >::: [
    "empty" >:: (fun _ -> assert_equal 1 (product []));
    "singleton one" >:: (fun _ -> assert_equal 1 (product [1]));
    "singleton five" >:: (fun _ -> assert_equal 5 (product [5]));
    "two_elements_both_one" >:: (fun _ -> assert_equal 1 (product [1; 1]));
    "two_elements_one_one" >:: (fun _ -> assert_equal 3 (product [1; 3]));
    "two_elements_neither_one" >:: (fun _ -> assert_equal 10 (product [5; 2]));
    "three_elements" >:: (fun _ -> assert_equal 30 (product [2; 3; 5]));
    "six_elements" >:: (fun _ -> assert_equal 720 (product [1;2;3;4;5;6]));
  ]

  let _ = run_test_tt_main tests
#+end_src

There's also a ~dune~ file:

#+begin_example
(executable
 (name test)
 (libraries ounit2))
#+end_example

And a ~dune-project~ file, containing:

#+begin_example
(lang dune 1.1)
(name product)
#+end_example

(Is this what ~dune~ needs in order to know where the root of the
current project is? It seems like this is the change that got rid of
that error / warning).

Now, we can run ~dune build test.exe~, followed by ~dune exec
test.exe~. This gives:

#+begin_example
........                           
Ran: 8 tests in: 0.11 seconds.
OK
#+end_example

It is still not clear to me that this is the "right" way to do
this. But it's close enough to the process outlined in section 3.3.1
in the book that I think I'll stick with this for now. I'd still like
to learn how to use ~dune~ properly, but I'll postpone that until later.

**** DONE Patterns [***]

Using pattern matching, write three functions, one for each of the following properties. Your functions should return true if the input list has the property and false otherwise.

+ the list’s first element is "bigred"

#+begin_src ocaml
  let bigred l = match l with
    | "bigred" :: xs -> true
    | _ -> false;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val bigred : string list -> bool = <fun>
#+end_src


#+begin_src ocaml
  [bigred ["smallred"];
   bigred ["bigred";"x";"y";"z"]]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : bool list = [false; true]
#+end_src

(I'm not sure how to make this polymorphic: if the first element is an
integer, I get a type error. But it's not clear from the phrasing of
the problem if that's necessary)

+ the list has exactly two or four elements; do not use the length
  function

#+begin_src ocaml
  let two_or_four l = match l with
    | x::y::[] -> true
    | x::y::z::w::[] -> true
    | _ -> false;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val two_or_four : 'a list -> bool = <fun>
#+end_src

A few tests:

#+begin_src ocaml
  [two_or_four [1;2;3;4];
   two_or_four ["a";"b"];
   two_or_four [1];
   two_or_four []]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : bool list = [true; true; false; false]
#+end_src
  
+ the first two elements of the list are equal

#+begin_src ocaml
  let first_two_equal l = match l with
    | x::y::xs when x = y -> true
    | _ -> false;;
#+end_src

#+begin_src ocaml
    [first_two_equal [1;2;3];
    first_two_equal [[1];[1];[1;2]];
    first_two_equal [[];[];[1;2]];
    first_two_equal ([[]]::[[]]::[]);
    first_two_equal ["a"]]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : bool list = [false; true; true; true; false]
#+end_src
  
**** DONE Library [***]

Consult the List standard library to solve these exercises:

+ Write a function that takes an int list and returns the fifth
  element of that list, if such an element exists. If the list has
  fewer than five elements, return 0. Hint: ~List.length~ and ~List.nth~.
  
#+begin_src ocaml
  let fifth_element l =
    if (List.length l >= 5) then (List.nth l 4) else (0);;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val fifth_element : int list -> int = <fun>
#+end_src

+ Write a function that takes an int list and returns the list sorted
in descending order. Hint: ~List.sort~ with ~Stdlib.compare~ as its
first argument, and ~List.rev~.
  
#+begin_src ocaml
  let descending_sort lst =
    lst
    |> List.sort Stdlib.compare
    |> List.rev;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val descending_sort : 'a list -> 'a list = <fun>
#+end_src

#+begin_src ocaml
  descending_sort [9;3;8;2;7;6;1;2;5;5]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : int list = [9; 8; 7; 6; 5; 5; 3; 2; 2; 1]
#+end_src

#+begin_src ocaml
  descending_sort ["mercury";
                   "venus";
                   "earth";
                   "mars";
                   "jupiter";
                   "saturn";
                   "uranus";
                   "neptune";
                   "pluto"]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : string list =
["venus"; "uranus"; "saturn"; "pluto"; "neptune"; "mercury"; "mars";
 "jupiter"; "earth"]
#+end_src

**** DONE Library Test [***]

Write a couple OUnit unit tests for each of the functions you wrote in
the previous exercise

Again, code is in the standalone directory.

The functions to be tested are in ~library.ml~, which contains

#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
  let fifth_element l =
    if (List.length l >= 5) then (List.nth l 4) else (0)

  let descending_sort lst =
    lst
    |> List.sort Stdlib.compare
    |> List.rev
#+end_src

Then we also need a dune file

#+begin_example
(executable
 (name test)
 (libraries ounit2))
#+end_example

as well as a dune-project file, it seems

#+begin_example
(lang dune 1.1)
(name library)
#+end_example

Finally, the test file, which contains:

#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
  open OUnit2
  open Library

  let tests = "test suite for these two functions" >::: [
    "empty list" >:: (fun _ -> assert_equal 0 (fifth_element []));
    "short list" >:: (fun _ -> assert_equal 0 (fifth_element [1;2;3]));
    "five elts" >:: (fun _ -> assert_equal 5 (fifth_element [1;2;3;4;5]));
    "repeat elts" >:: (fun _ -> assert_equal 4 (fifth_element [4;4;4;4;4;4;4]));
    "fifth zero" >:: (fun _ -> assert_equal 0 (fifth_element [1;2;3;4;0]));

    "empty sort" >:: (fun _ -> assert_equal [] (descending_sort []));
    "singleton sort" >:: (fun _ -> assert_equal [10] (descending_sort [10]));
    "pre-sorted" >:: (fun _ -> assert_equal [3;2;1] (descending_sort [3;2;1]));
    "reverse sort" >:: (fun _ -> assert_equal [5;4;3;2;1] (descending_sort [1;2;3;4;5]));
    "bigger sort" >:: (fun _ -> assert_equal [10;9;8;7;6;6;6;5] (descending_sort [5;6;10;9;6;6;7;8]));
  ]

  let _ = run_test_tt_main tests
#+end_src

Now doing ~dune build test.exe~ followed by ~dune exec ./test.exe~
gives

#+begin_example
..........                         
Ran: 10 tests in: 0.11 seconds.
OK
#+end_example

**** DONE Library Puzzle [***]

+ Write a function that returns the last element of a list. Your
  function may assume that the list is non-empty. Hint: Use two
  library functions, and do not write any pattern matching code of
  your own.

#+begin_src ocaml
  let last_element l = List.nth l (List.length l - 1);;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val last_element : 'a list -> 'a = <fun>
#+end_src

Small test:

#+begin_src ocaml
  last_element [1;4;3;2;3;7];;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : int = 7
#+end_src

+ Write a function ~any_zeroes : int list -> bool~ that returns ~true~
  if and only if the input list contains at least one ~0~. Hint: use
  one library function, and do not write any pattern matching code
  of your own.

#+begin_src ocaml
  let any_zeroes l = List.exists ((=) 0) l;;
#+end_src

A few tests

#+begin_src ocaml
  [any_zeroes [1;2;3;4;10];
   any_zeroes [1;2;3;-1;-2;-10];
   any_zeroes [];
   any_zeroes [1;1;1;1;0;1;1;2;2;3;3;4];
   any_zeroes [0]]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : bool list = [false; false; false; true; true]
#+end_src

**** DONE Take Drop [***]

+ Write a function ~take : int -> 'a list -> 'a list~ such that ~take
  n lst~ returns the first ~n~ elements of ~lst~. If ~lst~ has fewer
  than ~n~ elements, return all of them.

#+begin_src ocaml
    let rec take n l = match n with
      | 0 -> []
      | n -> (match l with
              | x :: xs -> x::(take (n-1) xs)
              | [] -> []);;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val take : int -> 'a list -> 'a list = <fun>
#+end_src

Small tests:

#+begin_src ocaml
  [take 2 [5;4;3;2;1];
   take 3 [1;2];
   take 0 [1;2];
   take 0 [];
   take 4 [3;2;1;2;3]]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : int list list = [[5; 4]; [1; 2]; []; []; [3; 2; 1; 2]]
#+end_src

+ Write a function ~drop : int -> 'a list -> 'a list~ such that ~drop
  n lst~ returns all but the first ~n~ elements of lst. If ~lst~ has
  fewer than ~n~ elements, return the empty list.

#+begin_src ocaml
  let rec drop n l = match n with
  | 0 -> l
  | n -> (match l with
          | x :: xs -> drop (n-1) xs
          | [] -> []);;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val drop : int -> 'a list -> 'a list = <fun>
#+end_src

Small tests:

#+begin_src ocaml
  [drop 3 [1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8];
   drop 2 [1];
   drop 3 [5;4;4];
   drop 0 [1;2;3]]
#+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  #+begin_src ocaml :exports code
  - : int list list = [[4; 5; 6; 7; 8]; []; []; [1; 2; 3]]
  #+end_src
 
**** DONE Take Drop Tail [****]

Revise your solutions for take and drop to be tail recursive, if they
aren’t already. Test them on long lists with large values of n to see
whether they run out of stack space. To construct long lists, use the
~--~ operator from the lists section.

Here's the ~--~ operator:

#+begin_src ocaml
let rec from i j l = if i > j then l else from i (j - 1) (j :: l);;

let ( -- ) i j = from i j [];;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val ( -- ) : int -> int -> int list = <fun>
#+end_src

Here's a long list (output suppressed)

#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
  let long_list = 0 -- 1_000_000;;
#+end_src

Here's a tail-recursive ~take~ function:

#+begin_src ocaml
  let take n l =
    let rec take_tr n l h = match n with
      | 0 -> h
      | n -> (match l with
              | [] -> h
              | x :: xs -> take_tr (n-1) (xs) (x :: h)) in
    List.rev (take_tr n l []);;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val take : int -> 'a list -> 'a list = <fun>
#+end_src

I am not sure whether I absolutely needed to use ~List.rev~ here. That
seems like a cost that should be avoided, if possible. It also means
I'm not 100% sure this is tail recursive unless I check whether or not
~List.rev~ is tail recursive. The documentation doesn't say whether it
is or isn't. In any case, here's the kind of call that would probably
stack overflow if the function weren't tail-recursive:

#+begin_src ocaml
  List.length (take 2000000 (6 -- 4000000))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : int = 2000000
#+end_src

Now for a tail-recursive drop function:

#+begin_src ocaml
    let rec drop n l =
      match n with
      | 0 -> l
      | n -> (match l with
             | [] -> []
             | x :: xs -> drop (n-1) xs);;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val drop : int -> 'a list -> 'a list = <fun>
#+end_src

And a call that would likely overflow the stack if it isn't tail
recursive:

#+begin_src ocaml
  drop 999999 (1 -- 1000000);;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : int list = [1000000]
#+end_src

It's not completely clear how to check whether or not something is
tail recursive. It seems like the givaway is when the recursive call
is part of a bigger expression instead of just the recursive function
being called on its own with modified arguments. The alternative is
just to test the kind of input that would probably overflow for a
non-tail-recursive function, though that seems iffy.

**** DONE Unimodal [***]

Write a function is_unimodal : int list -> bool that takes an integer
list and returns whether that list is unimodal. A unimodal list is a
list that monotonically increases to some maximum value then
monotonically decreases after that value. Either or both segments
(increasing or decreasing) may be empty. A constant list is unimodal,
as is the empty list.

#+begin_src ocaml
  let rec is_unimodal l =
    let rec is_nonincreasing l = match l with
    | [] -> true
    | x :: [] -> true
    | a :: b :: tail -> if (a < b)
                        then (false)
                        else (is_nonincreasing (b :: tail)) in
    match l with
    | [] -> true
    | x :: [] -> true
    | a :: b :: [] -> true
    | a :: b :: tail -> if (a <= b)
                        then (is_unimodal (b :: tail))
                        else (is_nonincreasing (b :: tail));;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val is_unimodal : 'a list -> bool = <fun>
#+end_src

Some tests, with comments on the expected ~false~ outputs. Note the polymorphism.

#+begin_src ocaml
        [is_unimodal [1;2;2;2;3;3;2;2];
        is_unimodal [1;2;3;4;4;4;5];
        is_unimodal [6;5;4;3;2;1];
        is_unimodal [1;2;3;3;2;1;2]; (* false *)
        is_unimodal [1;1;1;1;1];
        is_unimodal [0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1];
        is_unimodal [1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0];
        is_unimodal [4];
        is_unimodal [2;1;2]; (* false *)
        is_unimodal ['a';'b';'c';'b';'a'];
        is_unimodal ['b';'a';'a';'b']] (* false*) 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : bool list =
[true; true; true; false; true; true; true; true; false; true; false]
#+end_src

**** DONE Power set [***]

Write a function ~powerset : int list -> int list list~ that takes a
set ~S~ represented as a list and returns the set of all subsets of
~S~. The order of subsets in the powerset and the order of elements in
the subsets do not matter.

Hint: Consider the recursive structure of this problem. Suppose you
already have ~p~, such that ~p = powerset s~. How could you use ~p~ to
compute ~powerset (x :: s)~?

#+begin_src ocaml
  let rec powerset lst = match lst with
    | [] -> [[]]
    | x :: xs -> let p = powerset xs in
                 (List.map (fun s -> x::s) p) @ p;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val powerset : 'a list -> 'a list list = <fun>
#+end_src

One small test

#+begin_src ocaml
  powerset [1;2;3]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : int list list = [[1; 2; 3]; [1; 2]; [1; 3]; [1]; [2; 3]; [2]; [3]; []]
#+end_src

A slightly larger, though less precise test

#+begin_src ocaml
  List.length (powerset [1;2;3;4;5;6;7])
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : int = 128
#+end_src

**** DONE Print int list rec [**]

Write a function ~print_int_list : int list -> unit~ that prints its
input list, one number per line. For example, ~print_int_list [1; 2;
3]~ should result in this output:

#+begin_example
1
2
3
#+end_example

#+begin_src ocaml :results verbatim
    let rec print_int_list = function
      | [] -> ()
      | x :: xs -> (x |> string_of_int |> print_endline) ; print_int_list xs;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val print_int_list : int list -> unit = <fun>
#+end_src

As expected:

#+begin_src ocaml
  print_int_list [1;2;3]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
1
2
3
- : unit = ()
#+end_src

**** DONE Print int list iter [**]

Write a function ~print_int_list' : int list -> unit~ whose
specification is the same as ~print_int_list~. Do not use the keyword
~rec~ in your solution, but instead to use the ~List~ module function
~List.iter~.

#+begin_src ocaml :results verbatim
  let print_int_list lst = 
    List.iter (fun e -> e |> string_of_int |> print_endline) lst;;
#+end_src

#+end_src

**** DONE Date before [**]

Define a date-like triple to be a value of type ~int * int *
int~. Examples of date-like triples include ~(2013, 2, 1)~ and ~(0, 0,
1000)~. A date is a date-like triple whose first part is a positive
year (i.e., a year in the common era), second part is a month between
1 and 12, and third part is a day between 1 and 31 (or 30, 29, or 28,
depending on the month and year). (2013, 2, 1) is a date; (0, 0, 1000)
is not.

Write a function ~is_before~ that takes two dates as input and
evaluates to ~true~ or ~false~. It evaluates to true if the first
argument is a date that comes before the second argument. (If the two
dates are the same, the result is false.)

Your function needs to work correctly only for dates, not for
arbitrary date-like triples. However, you will probably find it easier
to write your solution if you think about making it work for arbitrary
date-like triples. For example, it’s easier to forget about whether
the input is truly a date, and simply write a function that claims
(for example) that January 100, 2013 comes before February 34,
2013—because any date in January comes before any date in February,
but a function that says that January 100, 2013 comes after February
34, 2013 is also valid. You may ignore leap years.

(I'm not convinced this is the "right" way to do this. Need to go back
through the chapter and see if I missed anything.

#+begin_src ocaml
  type date_like_triple = {year : int;
                           month : int;
                           day : int};;

  let is_before d1 d2 =
    let (y1, m1, d1, y2, m2, d2) = (d1.year,
                                    d1.month,
                                    d1.day,
                                    d2.year,
                                    d2.month,
                                    d2.day) in
    if y1 < y2 then true
    else if y1 > y2 then false
    else if m1 < m2 then true
    else if m1 > m2 then false
    else if d1 < d2 then true
    else if d1 >= d2 then false
    else false;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val is_before : date_like_triple -> date_like_triple -> bool = <fun>
#+end_src

A trivial test:
#+begin_src ocaml
  let date1 = {year=1988;month=6;day=22};;
  let date2 = {year=1986;month=7;day=14};;
  [is_before date1 date2; is_before date2 date1]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : bool list = [false; true]
#+end_src

**** DONE Earliest date [***]

Write a function ~earliest : (int*int*int) list -> (int * int * int)
option~. It evaluates to ~None~ if the input list is empty, and to
~Some d~ if ~date d~ is the earliest date in the list. Hint: use
~is_before~.

As in the previous exercise, your function needs to work correctly
only for dates, not for arbitrary date-like triples

#+begin_src ocaml
  let earliest lst =
    let rec earliest_carry d lst = match lst with
      | [] -> d
      | x :: xs -> if (is_before x d)
                   then (earliest_carry x xs)
                   else (earliest_carry d xs) in
    match lst with
    | [] -> None
    | x :: xs -> Some (earliest_carry x xs);;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val earliest : date_like_triple list -> date_like_triple option = <fun>
#+end_src

Small test using the two values defined in the previous problem:

#+begin_src ocaml
  earliest [date1; date2]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : date_like_triple option = Some {year = 1986; month = 7; day = 14}
#+end_src

**** DONE Assoc list [*]

Use the functions ~insert~ and ~lookup~ from the section on
association lists to construct an association list that maps the
integer ~1~ to the string ~“one”~, ~2~ to ~“two”~, and ~3~ to
~“three”~. Lookup the key ~2~. Lookup the key ~4~.

Here are ~insert~ and ~lookup~ from the section in question:

#+begin_src ocaml
  let insert k v lst = (k, v) :: lst

  let rec lookup k = function
    | [] -> None
    | (k', v) :: t -> if k = k' then Some v else lookup k t
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val insert : 'a -> 'b -> ('a * 'b) list -> ('a * 'b) list = <fun>
val lookup : 'a -> ('a * 'b) list -> 'b option = <fun>
#+end_src

Here we build the specified association list:
#+begin_src ocaml
    let assoc_list =
      []
      |> insert 1 "one"
      |> insert 2 "two"
      |> insert 3 "three";;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val assoc_list : (int * string) list = [(3, "three"); (2, "two"); (1, "one")]
#+end_src

When we lookup ~2~ we get the expected ~string~:

#+begin_src ocaml
  lookup 2 assoc_list;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : string option = Some "two"
#+end_src

But when we look up ~4~, we find ~None~:

#+begin_src ocaml
  lookup 4 assoc_list;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
- : string option = None
#+end_src

**** TODO Cards [**]

+ Define a variant type suit that represents the four suits, (hearts,
  clubs, diamonds and spades), in a standard 52-card deck. All the
  constructors of your type should be constant.

#+begin_src ocaml
    type suit =
    | Hearts
    | Clubs
    | Diamonds
    | Spades
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
type suit = Hearts | Clubs | Diamonds | Spades
#+end_src

+ Define a type rank that represents the possible ranks of a card: 2,
  3, …, 10, Jack, Queen, King, or Ace. There are many possible
  solutions; you are free to choose whatever works for you. One is to
  make rank be a synonym of int, and to assume that Jack=11, Queen=12,
  King=13, and Ace=1 or 14. Another is to use variants.

#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
  type face =
    | King
    | Queen
    | Jack

  type rank =
    | Number of int
    | Face of face
#+end_src

+ Define a type card that represents the suit and rank of a single
  card. Make it a record with two fields.

#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
  type card = {rank : rank; suit : suit}
#+end_src

+ Define a few values of type card: the Ace of Clubs, the Queen of
  Hearts, the Two of Diamonds, the Seven of Spades.

#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
  let ace_of_clubs = {rank = Number 1;
                      suit = Clubs};;

  let queen_of_hearts = {rank = Face Queen;
                         suit = Hearts};;

  let two_of_diamonds = {rank = Number 2;
                         suit = Diamonds};;

  let seven_of_spades = {rank = Number 7;
                         suit = Spades};;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml :exports code
val seven_of_spades : card = {rank = Number 7; suit = Spades}
#+end_src

**** TODO Matching [*]

For each pattern in the list below, give a value of type ~int option
list~ that does not match the pattern and is not the empty list, or
explain why that’s impossible.

1. ~Some x :: tl~

   ~[None]~ does not match, since the head does not match
   
2. ~[Some 3110; None]~

   ~[None]~ does not match, since the head does not match. Also, ~[Some
   3110; Some 3110]~ will not match, since the second element is not
   ~None~.
   
3. ~[Some x; _]~

   Again, ~[Some x; None; None]~ does not match. It's too long.
   
4. ~h1 :: h2 :: tl~

   Any list of length ~2~ or greater will match this pattern. But
   ~[None]~ does not match it.
   
5. ~h :: tl~

   This pattern matches every list except the empty list, so we can't
   match it with a nonempty list.
**** TODO Quadrant [**]

Complete the ~quadrant~ function below, which should return the quadrant
of the given ~x, y~ point according to the diagram on the right
(borrowed from Wikipedia). Points that lie on an axis do not belong to
any quandrant. Hints: (a) define a helper function for the sign of an
integer, (b) match against a pair.

#+begin_src ocaml
  type quad = I | II | III | IV
  type sign = Neg | Zero | Pos

  let sign (x:int) : sign =
    match x with
    | x when x > 0 -> Pos
    | x when x < 0 -> Neg
    | _ -> Zero

  let quadrant : int*int -> quad option = fun (x,y) ->
    match (sign x, sign y) with
      | (Pos, Pos) -> Some I
      | (Neg, Pos) -> Some II
      | (Neg, Neg) -> Some III
      | (Pos, Neg) -> Some IV
      | _ -> None;;

  quadrant (13,-58);;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Some IV

**** TODO Quadrant when [**]

Rewrite the quadrant function to use the when syntax. You won’t need
your helper function from before.

#+begin_src ocaml
  let quadrant_when : int*int -> quad option = function
      | (x,y) when x > 0 && y > 0 -> Some I
      | (x,y) when x < 0 && y > 0 -> Some II
      | (x,y) when x < 0 && y < 0 -> Some III
      | (x,y) when x > 0 && y < 0 -> Some IV
      | _ -> None;;

  quadrant_when (13,-58)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Some IV

**** TODO Depth [**]

Write a function ~depth : 'a tree -> int~ that returns the number of
nodes in any longest path from the root to a leaf. For example, the
depth of an empty tree (simply ~Leaf~) is ~0~, and the depth of tree
~t~ above is ~3~. Hint: there is a library function ~max : 'a -> 'a ->
'a~ that returns the maximum of any two values of the same type.

#+begin_src ocaml
  type 'a tree =
  | Leaf
  | Node of 'a * 'a tree * 'a tree
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: type 'a tree = Leaf | Node of 'a * 'a tree * 'a tree

Here's the tree from 3.11.1:

#+begin_src ocaml
(* the code below constructs this tree:
         4
       /   \
      2     5
     / \   / \
    1   3 6   7
*)
let t =
  Node(4,
    Node(2,
      Node(1, Leaf, Leaf),
      Node(3, Leaf, Leaf)
    ),
    Node(5,
      Node(6, Leaf, Leaf),
      Node(7, Leaf, Leaf)
    )
  )
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Node (4, Node (2, Node (1, Leaf, Leaf), Node (3, Leaf, Leaf)),
:    Node (5, Node (6, Leaf, Leaf), Node (7, Leaf, Leaf)))

#+begin_src ocaml
    let depth t =
      let rec depth_tr d t = match t with
      | Leaf -> d
      | Node (x, left, right) -> max (depth_tr (d+1) left) (depth_tr (d+1) right) in
    depth_tr 0 t;;

    depth Leaf;;
    depth (Node(1, Leaf, Node(1, Leaf, Leaf)));;
    depth t
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 3

**** TODO Shape [***]

Write a function ~same_shape : 'a tree -> 'b tree -> bool~ that
determines whether two trees have the same shape, regardless of
whether the values they carry at each node are the same. Hint: use a
pattern match with three branches, where the expression being matched
is a pair of trees.

#+begin_src ocaml
    let rec same_shape t1 t2 = match (t1, t2) with
      | (Leaf, Leaf) -> true
      | (Node(_, left1, right1), Node(_, left2, right2)) -> ((same_shape left1 left2) && (same_shape right1 right2))

      | _ -> false;;

    same_shape (Node(4,t,t)) (Node(1, t, t));;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: true

**** TODO List max exn [**]

Write a function ~list_max : int list -> int~ that returns the maximum integer in a list, or raises ~Failure "list_max"~ if the list is empty.

#+begin_src ocaml
      let rec list_max_exn lst =
        let rec list_max_exn_acc m lst = match lst with
          | x :: xs -> if (x > m)
                       then (list_max_exn_acc x xs)
                       else (list_max_exn_acc m xs)
          | [] -> m in
      match List.hd lst with
      | exception (_) -> failwith "list_max"
      | m -> list_max_exn_acc m (List.tl lst);;

    list_max_exn [1;2;3;4;56;6;7;6;5;4;5;0;0;0;11;12;13];;
    list_max_exn []
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Exception: Failure "list_max".

There is something going on here that I don't understand. I thought
that if you had a match expression, every possible match needs to
evaluate to the same type. But in the second match expression in the
above code, the first branch looks like it has type ~exception~ while
the second has type ~int~ or maybe ~'a~.

I also got a weird warning when I matched with ~exception (Failure
"hd")~ ("fragile-literal-pattern) that went away when I changed to to
~exception (_)~, though this seems less accurate.

**** TODO List max exn string [**]

Write a function ~list_max_string : int list -> string~ that returns a
string containing the maximum integer in a list, or the string
~"empty"~ (note, not the exception ~Failure "empty"~ but just the
string ~"empty"~) if the list is empty. Hint: ~string_of_int~ in the
standard library will do what its name suggests.

#+begin_src ocaml
        let list_max_string lst =
          let rec list_max_string_acc m lst = match lst with
            | [] -> m
            | x :: xs -> if (x > m)
                         then (list_max_string_acc x xs)
                         else(list_max_string_acc m xs) in
          match lst with
          | [] -> "empty"
          | x :: xs -> list_max_string_acc x xs |> string_of_int;;

        list_max_string [123;252435;12312;345435;123];;
        list_max_string [99999;99998];;
        list_max_string []
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: empty

**** TODO List max exn ounit [*]
**** TODO is_bst [****]

Write a function ~is_bst : ('a*'b) tree -> bool~ that returns true if and only if the given tree satisfies the binary search tree invariant. An efficient version of this function that visits each node at most once is somewhat tricky to write. Hint: write a recursive helper function that takes a tree and either gives you (i) the minimum and maximum value in the tree, or (ii) tells you that the tree is empty, or (iii) tells you that the tree does not satisfy the invariant. Your ~is_bst~ function will not be recursive, but will call your helper function and pattern match on the result. You will need to define a new variant type for the return type of your helper function.

I don't really understand the signature of the specified function. Why
do we need to be working with a tree of ordered pairs of type
~('a*'b)~ ? It would make sense to write a polymorphic ~is_bst~ for
any ~'a tree~ where ~'a~ is a type that that admits a total order. But
why a tree of pairs of two types?

Maybe just do it for ~int tree~ for now?

**** TODO Quadrant poly  [**]

Modify your definition of ~quadrant~ to use polymorphic variants. The
types of your functions should become these:

#+begin_src ocaml

~double~ is a function of type ~int -> int~, while ~twice~ is
(polymorphically) a function that takes a function of type ~T -> T~
and produces a new function of type ~T -> T~. So when applied to
~double~, it gives a new function ~int -> int~.

Can also think of it in terms of currying: ~twice f x~ means ~f (f
x)~, so ~twice f~ is a function still waiting for its last argument.

#+RESULTS:
: val quad : int -> int = <fun>

#+begin_src ocaml :results verbatim
  let fourth = twice square
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: val fourth : int -> int = <fun>

The same description of ~twice double~ applies to ~twice square~ as
well, since ~double~ and ~square~ have the same type.
**** DONE Mystery Operator 1 [**]

What does the following operator do?

#+begin_src ocaml
    let ( $ ) f x = f x;;



    double $ 3 + 1;;

    ($) (double) (3 + 1) ;;

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 8

~$~ is an infix operator that applies its left argument to its right
argument. So ~f $ x~ evaluates to ~f x~. But because of the precedence
of operator binding, ~double 3 + 1~ is ~(double 3) + 1~, which is
~7~. But ~double $ 3 + 1~ is ~($) (double) (3 + 1)~, which is ~8~

**** DONE Mystery Operator 2 [**]

What does the following operator do?

#+begin_src ocaml
  let ( @@ ) f g x = x |> g |> f;;

  (String.length @@ string_of_int) 10;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Line 2, characters 0-35:
: 2 | (String.length @@ string_of_int) 10;
:     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
: Warning 10 [non-unit-statement]: this expression should have type unit.
: Line 3, characters 0-13:
: 3 | String.length string_of_int 10;;
:     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
: Error: This function has type string -> int
:        It is applied to too many arguments; maybe you forgot a `;'.

~@@~ is an "infix" (sort of) operator, where ~f @@ g~ is a function
that, when applied to ~x~, give ~f (g x)~ (as opposed to ~f g
x~). This is function composition.

**** DONE Repeat [**]

Generalize ~twice~ to a function ~repeat~, such that ~repeat f n x~ applies ~f~ to ~x~ a total of ~n~ times.

#+begin_src ocaml
    let rec repeat f n x = match n with
      | 0 -> x
      | n -> f (repeat f (n-1) x);;

    repeat double 10 1;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 1024

**** DONE Product [*]

Use ~fold_left~ to write a function ~product_left~ that computes the product of a list of floats. The product of the empty list is ~1.0~. Hint: recall how we implemented sum in just one line of code in lecture.

~fold left~ is defined below. For a specific binary function ~f~, a starting
"accumulation" value ~a~ and a list like (for example) ~[1;2;3]~, it
gives ~f (f (f a 1) 2) 3~. If the binary function is multiplication
and the initial accumulation value is ~1~, you'll get the product of
the elements in the list.

#+begin_src ocaml
  let rec fold_left f acc = function
    | [] -> acc
    | h :: t -> fold_left f (f acc h) t;;

  let product_left = fold_left ( * ) 1;;

  product_left [1;2;3;4]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 24

Use ~fold_right~ to write a function ~product_right~ that computes the product of a list of floats. Same hint applies

Again, ~fold_right~ is defined below: Given ~f~, ~a~ and ~[1;2;3]~ as
above, you'd get ~f 1 (f 2 (f 3 a))~.

I think the only difference here is that you "need" (probably a way
around it though) to specificy the list argument to ~product_right~.

#+begin_src ocaml
  let rec fold_right f lst acc = match lst with
    | [] -> acc
    | h :: t -> f h (fold_right f t acc);;

  let product_right lst = fold_right ( * ) lst 1;;

  product_right [1;2;3;4;5]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: <fun>

**** DONE Terse Product [**]

How terse can you make your solutions to the ~product~ exercise?
Hints: you need only one line of code for each, and you do not need
the ~fun~ keyword. For ~fold_left~, your function definition does not
even need to explicitly take a list argument. If you use ~ListLabels~,
the same is true for ~fold_right~.

I think my product_left is about as terse as possible already. To
eliminate the argument from the left hand side of product_right, you
could do:

#+begin_src ocaml
    let rec fold_right ~fn:f ~list:lst ~a:acc = match lst with
      | [] -> acc
      | h :: t -> f h (fold_right ~fn:f ~list:t ~a:acc)

    let product_right_terse = fold_right ~fn:( * ) ~a:1;;

    product_right_terse [1;2;3;4;5;6]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 720

(should figure out exactly the syntax and conventions for labelled
argument, since I don't feel like I did this exactly the right way.)

**** DONE sum cube odd [**]

Write a function ~sum_cube_odd n~ that computes the sum of the cubes
of all the odd numbers between ~0~ and ~n~ inclusive. Do not write any
new recursive functions. Instead, use the functionals ~map~, ~fold~,
and ~filter~, and the ~( -- )~ operator (defined in the discussion of
pipelining).

The infix range operator from earlier in the chapter:
#+begin_src ocaml
  let rec ( -- ) i j = if i > j then [] else i :: i + 1 -- j;;
#+end_src

#+begin_src ocaml

  let sum_cube_odd n =
    let odd m = m mod 2 = 1 in
    let cube x = x * x * x in
    (1 -- n)
    |> List.filter odd
    |> List.map cube
    |> List.fold_left (+) 0 ;;

  sum_cube_odd 10
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 1225

**** DONE sum cube odd pipeline [**]

Rewrite the previous function with the pipeline ~|>~ operator. (I
already used it a fair bit in the previous, But I guess with even
fewer inner ~let~ statements and more pipelininig it could be written:

#+begin_src ocaml
    let sum_cube_odd_pipeline n =
      n
      |> (--) 1
      |> List.filter (fun m -> m mod 2 = 1)
      |> List.map (fun x -> x * x * x)
      |> List.fold_left (+) 0 ;;

  sum_cube_odd_pipeline 10
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 1225

**** DONE exists [**]
Consider writing a function ~exists: ('a -> bool) -> 'a list -> bool~, such that ~exists p [a1; ...; an]~ returns whether at least one element of the list satisfies the predicate ~p~. That is, it evaluates the same as ~(p a1) || (p a2) || ... || (p an)~. When applied to an empty list, it evaluates to false.

Write three solutions to this problem, as we did above:

+ ~exists_rec~, which must be a recursive function that does not use the
  ~List~ module.

  #+begin_src ocaml :results verbatim
        let rec exists_rec p lst = match lst with
          | [] -> false
          | x :: xs -> if p x then true else exists_rec p xs;;

        let even n = n mod 2 = 0;;
        let odd n = n mod 2 = 1 || n mod 2 < 0;;

        exists_rec even [1;2;3;4;5;6;7];;
        exists_rec odd [-2;-4;-6;-8]
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : - : bool = false
  
+ ~exists_fold~, which uses either ~List.fold_left~ or ~List.fold_right~,
  but not any other ~List~ module functions nor the ~rec~ keyword.

  #+begin_src ocaml :results verbatim
        let exists_fold p lst =
          lst |> List.fold_left (fun x y -> x || p y) false;;

        exists_fold even [1;3;5;7];;
        exists_fold odd [-2;0;2;6];;
        exists_fold even [1;2;3;4;5];;
        exists_fold even []
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : - : bool = false

+ ~exists_lib~, which uses any combination of ~List~ module functions
  other than ~fold_left~ or ~fold_right~, and does not use the ~rec~
  keyword.

  #+begin_src ocaml
    let exists_lib p lst =
      match lst
            |> List.find_map (fun x -> if (p x)
                                       then (Some x)
                                       else (None)) with
    | Some x -> true
    | None -> false;;

    exists_lib even [1;3;5;8]
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : true

(There are probably lots of ways to do this one)

**** TODO account balance [***]

Write a function which, given a list of numbers representing debits,
deducts them from an account balance, and finally returns the
remaining amount in the balance. Write three versions: fold_left,
fold_right, and a direct recursive implementation.

**** DONE library uncurried [**]

Here is an uncurried version of ~List.nth~:

#+begin_src ocaml
  let uncurried_nth (lst, n) = List.nth lst n
#+end_src

In a similar way, write uncurried versions of these library functions:

+ ~List.append~

  #+begin_src ocaml
        let uncurried_append (l1, l2) = List.append l1 l2;;
        uncurried_append ([1;2;3],[3;4;5])

  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 5 |

+ ~Char.compare~

  #+begin_src ocaml
        let uncurried_compare (c1, c2) = Char.compare c1 c2;;

        uncurried_compare ('a','a');;
        uncurried_compare ('a','z');;
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : -25

+ ~Stdlib.max~

  #+begin_src ocaml
        let uncurried_max (v1, v2) = Stdlib.max v1 v2;;

        uncurried_max (15, 16)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 16

**** DONE map composition [***]

Show how to replace any expression of the form ~List.map f (List.map g
lst)~ with an equivalent expression that calls ~List.map~ only once.

The expression

#+begin_src ocaml
  let f x = x + 1;;
  let g x = 3 * x;;
  let lst = [1;2;3;4];;
  (* The expression *)
  List.map f (List.map g lst);;
  (* Could instead be written as follows *)
  List.map (fun x -> f (g x)) lst
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| 4 | 7 | 10 | 13 |

**** DONE more list fun [***]

Write functions that perform the following computations. Each function
that you write should use one of ~List.fold~, ~List.map~ or
~List.filter~. To choose which of those to use, think about what the
computation is doing: combining, transforming, or filtering elements.

+ Find those elements of a list of strings whose length is strictly
  greater than ~3~.

#+begin_src ocaml
    let long_strings lst =
      let long_enough s = String.length s > 3 in
      List.filter long_enough lst;;

    long_strings ["a";"hello";"world";"!!!";"!";"!!!!"]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| hello | world | !!!! |

+ Add ~1.0~ to every element of a list of floats.

  #+begin_src ocaml :results verbatim
    let increment_floats lst =
      lst |> List.map (fun x -> x +. 1.0);;

    increment_floats [1.;2.;3.;7.];;
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : - : float list = [2.; 3.; 4.; 8.]

+ Given a list of strings strs and another string sep, produce the
  string that contains every element of strs separated by sep. For
  example, given inputs ["hi";"bye"] and ",", produce "hi,bye", being
  sure not to produce an extra comma either at the beginning or end of
  the result string.

  #+begin_src ocaml :results verbatim
    let delimit_strings lst sep = match lst with
    | [] -> ""
    | x :: [] -> x
    | x :: xs -> x ^ (List.fold_left (fun a b -> a ^ sep ^ b) "" xs);;

    delimit_strings ["0";"1";"2";"3";"4";"5";"6";"7";] " -- " 
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : - : string = "0 -- 1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4 -- 5 -- 6 -- 7"

**** DONE association list keys [***]

Recall that an association list is an implementation of a dictionary
in terms of a list of pairs, in which we treat the first component of
each pair as a key and the second component as a value.

Write a function ~keys: ('a * 'b) list -> 'a list~ that returns a list of the unique keys in an association list. Since they must be unique, no value should appear more than once in the output list. The order of values output does not matter. How compact and efficient can you make your solution? Can you do it in one line and linearithmic space and time? Hint: ~List.sort_uniq~.

#+begin_src ocaml
    let keys al = List.map (fun (k,v) -> k) al |> List.sort_uniq (fun k1 k2 -> if (k1 < k2) then (-1) else (if k1 > k2 then 1 else 0));;

    keys [('a',12);('b',13);('c',120);('c',14);('c',9356);('z',19);('a',53);('d',13);('e',63)]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| a | b | c | d | e | z |

I don't know if this is n log n space and time. I'm also not sure if
this is the "one line" solution they're hinting at, since it's a bit
long for one line.

**** TODO valid matrix [***]

A mathematical matrix can be represented with lists. In row-major
representation, this matrix

\[\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 9 & 8 & 7 \end{bmatrix}\]

would be represented as the list ~[[1; 1; 1]; [9; 8; 7]]~. Let’s represent a row vector as an int list. For example, ~[9; 8; 7]~ is a row vector.

A valid matrix is an ~int list list~ that has at least one row, at
least one column, and in which every column has the same number of
rows. There are many values of type ~int list list~ that are invalid,
for example

+ []
+ [[1;2];[3]]

  Implement a function ~is_valid_matrix: int list list -> bool~ that
  returns whether the input matrix is valid. Unit test the function.

  #+begin_src ocaml
        let is_valid_matrix m = match m with
          | [] -> false
          | r :: rs -> (match r with
                      | [] -> false
                      | _ -> let n = List.length r in
                             if List.exists (fun r2 -> List.length r2 <> n) rs then false else true);;

        is_valid_matrix [[1;2];[3;4]];;
        is_valid_matrix [[1;2;3]];;
        is_valid_matrix [[1;2;3];[4;5]]
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : false

  (still need to do the unit test part of this problem)
  
**** TODO row vector add [***]

Implement a function ~add_row_vectors: int list -> int list -> int list~
for the element-wise addition of two row vectors. For example, the
addition of ~[1; 1; 1]~ and ~[9; 8; 7]~ is ~[10; 9; 8]~. If the two vectors
do not have the same number of entries, the behavior of your function
is unspecified—that is, it may do whatever you like. Hint: there is an
elegant one-line solution using ~List.map2~. Unit test the function

#+begin_src ocaml :results verbatim
    let add_row_vectors r1 r2 = List.map2 (+) r1 r2;;

    add_row_vectors [1;2;3] [6;7;10];;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: - : int list = [7; 9; 13]

**** TODO matrix add [***]

Implement a function ~add_matrices: int list list -> int list list ->
int list list~ for matrix addition. If the two input matrices are not
the same size, the behavior is unspecified. Hint: there is an elegant
one-line solution using ~List.map2~ and ~add_row_vectors~. Unit test the
function.

#+begin_src ocaml :results verbatim
    let add_matrices m1 m2 = List.map2 add_row_vectors m1 m2;;

    add_matrices [[0;1;2];[3;4;5];[6;7;8]] [[9;10;11];[12;13;14];[15;16;17]]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: - : int list list = [[9; 11; 13]; [15; 17; 19]; [21; 23; 25]]

**** TODO matrix multiply [****]

Implement a function ~multiply_matrices: int list list -> int list list
-> int list list~ for matrix multiplication. If the two input matrices
are not of sizes that can be multiplied together, the behavior is
unspecified. Unit test the function. Hint: define functions for matrix
transposition and row vector dot product.

#+begin_src ocaml :results verbatim
  let rec multiply_matrices m1 m2 =
    let dot r1 r2 = List.fold_left (+) 0 (List.map2 ( * ) r1 r2) in
    let rec row_to_column r = match r with
      | [] -> []
      | e :: es -> [e] :: row_to_column es in
    let rec transpose m = match m with
      | [] -> []
      | r :: [] -> row_to_column r
      | r :: rs -> List.map2 (@) (row_to_column r) (transpose rs) in
    let rec row_of_r_m r m = match m with
      | [] -> []
      | t :: ts -> (dot r t) :: (row_of_r_m r ts) in
    match m1 with
    | [] -> []
    | r :: rs -> (row_of_r_m r (transpose m2)) :: multiply_matrices rs m2;;

  multiply_matrices [[6;41];[1;7]] [[7;-41];[-1;6]]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: - : int list list = [[1; 0]; [0; 1]]

Done, but still need to do the unit testing on all these matrix problems

*** 5.11 Modular Programming - Exercises [4/29]
**** DONE Complex synonym [*]

Here is a module type for complex numbers, which have a real and imaginary component:

#+begin_src ocaml
  module type ComplexSig = sig
    val zero : float * float
    val add : float * float -> float * float -> float * float
  end
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: module type ComplexSig =
:   sig
:     val zero : float * float
:     val add : float * float -> float * float -> float * float
:   end

Improve that code by adding ~type t = float * float~. Show how the
signature can be written more tersely because of the type synonym.

#+begin_src ocaml
  module type ComplexSig = sig
    type t = float * float
    val zero : t
    val add : t -> t -> t
  end
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: module type ComplexSig =
:   sig type t = float * float val zero : t val add : t -> t -> t end

**** DONE Complex encapsulation [**]

Here is a module for the module type from the previous exercise:

#+begin_src ocaml
    module Complex : ComplexSig = struct
      type t = float * float
      let zero = (0., 0.)
      let add (r1, i1) (r2, i2) = r1 +. r2, i1 +. i2
    end
#+end_src

Investigate what happens if you make the following changes (each
independently), and explain why any errors arise:

+ remove ~zero~ from the structure

  #+begin_src ocaml
    module Complex : ComplexSig = struct
      type t = float * float
      (*let zero = (0., 0.)*)

  #+begin_example
  Lines 1-5, characters 30-3:
  1 | ..............................struct
  2 |   type t = float * float
  3 |   (*let zero = (0., 0.)*)
  4 |   let add (r1, i1) (r2, i2) = r1 +. r2, i1 +. i2
  5 | end..
  Error: Signature mismatch:
         Modules do not match:

           end
         is not included in
           ComplexSig
         The value `zero' is required but not provided
  #+end_example

The ~ComplexSig~ type, defined in the previous problem, requires a
~zero~ and an ~add~. When zero is missing, the structure defined here
is not an instance of the ComplexSig type specified. 

+ remove ~add~ from the signature
#+begin_src ocaml
    module Complex : ComplexSig = struct
      type t = float * float
      let zero = (0., 0.)
      (*let add (r1, i1) (r2, i2) = r1 +. r2, i1 +. i2*)
    end

5 | end..
Error: Signature mismatch:
       Modules do not match:

       is not included in
         ComplexSig
       The value `add' is required but not provided
#+end_example

Same problem as above: the type ~ComplexSig~ needs an ~add~
function. If it's missing, you don't have an instance of that type

+ change ~zero~ in the structure to ~let zero = 0, 0~

  #+begin_src ocaml
    module Complex : ComplexSig = struct
      type t = float * float
      let zero = 0, 0
      let add (r1, i1) (r2, i2) = r1 +. r2, i1 +. i2
    end
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  #+begin_example
  Lines 1-5, characters 30-3:
  1 | ..............................struct
  2 |   type t = float * float
  3 |   let zero = 0, 0
  4 |   let add (r1, i1) (r2, i2) = r1 +. r2, i1 +. i2
  5 | end..
  Error: Signature mismatch:
         ...
         Values do not match:
           val zero : int * int
         is not included in
           val zero : t
  #+end_example

The ~ComplexSig~ type needs ~zero~ to have type ~float * float~. Since
the ~zero~ in this module has type ~int * int~, it doesn't typecheck
as being an instance of ~ComplexSig~.

**** TODO Big list queue [**]

Use the following code to create ~ListQueue~ of exponentially increasing length: 10, 100, 1000, etc. How big of a queue can you create before there is a noticeable delay? How big until there’s a delay of at least 10 seconds? (Note: you can abort utop computations with Ctrl-C.)

Need the ~Queue~ signatur and the ~ListQueue~ type from section
5.6. Copied here with comments removed, since they were interfering
with the emacs / tuareg process in some way.

#+begin_src ocaml

Modify your implementation of ~Fraction~ to ensure these invariants
hold of every value ~v~ of type ~t~ that is returned from ~make~, ~add~, and ~mul~:

+ ~v~ is in reduced form
+ the denominator of ~v~ is positive

For the first invariant, you might find this implementation of
Euclid’s algorithm to be helpful:

Prove that ~exp x (m + n) = exp x m * exp x n~, where

#+begin_src ocaml
  let rec exp x n =
    if n = 0 then 1 else x * exp x (n - 1)
#+end_src

Proceed by induction on $n$.

When $n = 0$, we have:

#+begin_example
   exp x (m + n)
 = exp x (m + 0)     (by assumption)
 = exp x m           (arith)
 = exp x m * 1       (arith)
 = exp x m * exp x 0 (by definition)
 = exp x m * exp x n (by assumption)
#+end_example

Now assume the equality holds for some fixed $n$ value, say $n =
k$. It remains to prove the equality in the case where $n = k + 1$:

#+begin_example
   exp x (m + (k + 1))
 = exp x ((m + k) + 1)         (associativity of +)
 = exp x (m + k) * x           (by definition of exp)
 = exp x m * exp x k * x       (by induction)
 = exp x m * exp x k * exp x 1 (by definition)
 = exp x m * exp x (k + 1)     (by definition of exp)
#+end_example

This concludes the proof.

*** 7.5 Mutability - Exercises [10/11]
**** DONE mutable fields [*]

Define an OCaml record type to represent student names and GPAs. It
should be possible to mutate the value of a student’s GPA. Write an
expression defining a student with name ~"Alice"~ and GPA ~3.7~. Then
write an expression to mutate Alice’s GPA to ~4.0~

#+begin_src ocaml
  (* defining a record type with a mutable gpa field: *)
  type student = {name : string; mutable gpa: float};;

  (* create the specified instance *)
  let student_rec = {name = "Alice"; gpa = 3.7};;

  (* change the gpa as specified *)
  student_rec.gpa <- 4.0;;

  (* inspect to confirm *)
  student_rec
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: {name = "Alice"; gpa = 4.}

**** DONE refs [*]

Give OCaml expressions that have the following types. Use utop to
check your answers.

+ ~bool ref~

#+begin_src ocaml
  let br = ref true;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src ocaml
val br : bool ref = {contents = true}
#+end_src

+ ~int list ref~

#+begin_src ocaml :results verbatim
  let ilr = ref [1;2;3]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: val ilr : int list ref = {contents = [1; 2; 3]}

+ ~int ref list~

#+begin_src ocaml :results verbatim
  List.map (fun i -> ref i) [1;2]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: - : int ref list = [{contents = 1}; {contents = 2}]

**** DONE inc fun [*]

Define a reference to a function as follows:

#+begin_src ocaml
  let inc = ref (fun x -> x + 1)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: {contents = <fun>}

Write code that uses ~inc~ to produce the value ~3110~.

(This is disgusting)
#+begin_src ocaml
    let p = ref 0 in
    let q = ref 0 in
    let r = ref 0 in
    while ((!p) < 2)
    do (p := !p + 1)
    done;
    while ((!q) < 5)
    do (q := !q + 1)
    done;
    while ((!r) < 311)
    do (r := !r + 1)
    done;
    (!p) * (!q) * (!r);
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 3110

**** DONE addition assignment [**]

The ~C~ language and many languages derived from it, such as Java, has
an addition assignment operator written ~a += b~ and meaning ~a = a +
b~. Implement such an operator in OCaml; its type should be ~int ref
-> int -> unit~.

(uncomfortably close to line noise here, this function is like 60% punctuation)

#+begin_src ocaml
  let ( +:= ) x y = x := !x + y;;

  let x = ref 0;;

  x +:= 12;;
  x +:= 28;;
  x +:= -3;;

  !x;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 37

**** DONE physical equality [**]

Define ~x~, ~y~, and ~z~ as follows:

#+begin_src ocaml
  let x = ref 0
  let y = x
  let z = ref 0
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: {contents = 0}

Predict the value of the following series of expressions:

- ~x == y;;~
- ~x == z;;~
- ~x = y;;~
- ~x = z;;~
- ~x := 1;;~
- ~x = y;;~
- ~x = z;;~

+ ~# x == y;;~

~y~ is another name for ~x~. They should be equal.

#+begin_src ocaml
  x == y
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: true

+ ~# x == z;;~

~x~ and ~z~ are two different references. Different boxes with the
same content are not the same box. They should not be equal

#+begin_src ocaml
  x == z
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: false

+ ~# x = y;;~

My guess is that structural equality (same thing in memory) is
stronger than mathematical equality (evaluate to the same value), so
I'm guessing this is true:

#+begin_src ocaml
  x = y
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: true

+ ~# x = z;;~

both ~x~ and ~z~ are the same "value" (a reference containing a zero),
so I expect them to be "equal" despite not being the same reference.

#+begin_src ocaml
  x = z
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: true

+ ~# x := 1;;~

Switching the contents of reference ~x~ from ~0~ to ~1~.

#+begin_src ocaml
  x := 1
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: ()

+ ~# x = y;;~

~y~ is just a different name for the exact same location in
memory. When we changed ~x~, we also changed ~y~. They are still
(structurally) equal so they should still be mathematically equal

#+begin_src ocaml
  x = y
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: true

+ ~# x = z;;~

These two used to be references containing the same value. But now ~x~
contains ~1~ while ~z~ still contains ~0~. So they should no longer be
equal.

#+begin_src ocaml
  x = z
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: false

**** DONE norm [**]

The Euclidean norm of an $n$-dimensional vector $x = (x_1, \ldots,
x_n)$ is written $|x|$ and is defined to be $$\sqrt{x_1^2 + \cdots +
x_n^2}.$$ Write a function ~norm: vector -> float~ that computes the
Euclidean norm of a vector, where ~vector~ is defined as follows:

#+begin_src ocaml
  (* AF: the float array [| x1; ...; xn |] represents the
   ,*     vector (x1, ..., xn)
   ,* RI: the array is non-empty *)
  type vector = float array
#+end_src

#+begin_src ocaml
  let norm vect = 
    vect
    |> Array.map (function x -> x *. x)
    |> Array.fold_left (+.) 0.
    |> Float.sqrt;;

  norm [|5.0; 12.0|];;

  norm [|0.0;12.0;34.0;56.0;78.0|]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 102.56705123966468

**** DONE normalize [**]

Every vector $x$ can be normalized by dividing each component by
$|x|$. This yields a vector with norm $1$.

Write a function ~normalize : vector -> unit~ that normalizes a vector
“in place” by mutating the input array. Here’s a sample usage:

#+begin_src ocaml
  # let a = [|1.; 1.|];;
  val a : float array = [|1.; 1.|]

  # normalize a;;
  - : unit = ()

  # a;;
  - : float array = [|0.7071...; 0.7071...|]
#+end_src

This works and doesn't use a loop, but it's not clear to me that it's
the "right" way to do this. Seems like an abuse of ~mapi~, and my
suspicion is there's something better suited to this purpose.

#+begin_src ocaml :results verbatim
  let normalize vect =
    let n = norm vect in
    let replace_at i e = vect.(i) <- e /. n in
    ignore (vect |> Array.mapi replace_at);;

  let v = [|3.0; 4.0|];;
  norm v;;
  normalize v;;
  v;;
  norm v;;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: - : float = 1.

**** DONE norm loop [**]

Modify your implementation of ~norm~ to use a loop.

#+begin_src ocaml
  let norm vect =
    let len = Array.length vect in
    let sum_of_squares = ref 0.0 in
    let i = ref 0 in
    while (!i < len)
    do (sum_of_squares := !sum_of_squares +. (vect.(!i) *. vect.(!i));
        i := !i + 1)
    done;
    Float.sqrt(!sum_of_squares);;

  norm [|5.0; 12.0|]
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 13

**** DONE normalize loop [**]

Modify your implementation of ~normalize~ to use a loop.

#+begin_src ocaml :results verbatim
      let normalize vect =
        let len = Array.length vect in
        let n = norm vect in
        let i = ref 0 in
        while !i < len
        do (vect.(!i) <- vect.(!i) /. n;
            i := !i + 1)
        done;;

      let v = [| 3.0; 4.0 |];;

      print_endline (string_of_float (norm v));
      normalize v;
      print_endline (string_of_float (norm v));;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 5.
: 1.
: - : unit = ()

**** DONE init matrix [***]

The ~Array~ module contains two functions for creating an array:
~make~ and ~init~. ~make~ creates an array and fills it with a default
value, while ~init~ creates an array and uses a provided function to
fill it in. The library also contains a function ~make_matrix~ for
creating a two-dimensional array, but it does not contain an analogous
~init_matrix~ to create a matrix using a function for initialization.

Write a function ~init_matrix : int -> int -> (int -> int -> 'a) -> 'a
array array~ such that ~~init_matrix n o f~ creates and returns an ~n~
by ~o~ matrix ~m~ with ~m.(i).(j) = f i j~ for all ~i~ and ~j~ in
bounds.

See the documentation for ~make_matrix~ for more information on the
representation of matrices as arrays.

(I refuse to use "n x o" matrix. All matrices are m x n. C'mon now.)

#+begin_src ocaml
  let init_matrix m n f = 
    Array.init m (fun i -> Array.init n (fun j -> f i j));;
#+end_src

#+begin_src ocaml
  init_matrix 4 4 (fun i j -> i + 2*j)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
