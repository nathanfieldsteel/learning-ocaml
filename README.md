Working on learning functional programming through ~OCaml~, with a side goal of learning to use ~org-mode~ as a literate programming environment.

Working through the exercises in the CS3110 book, the problems on the 99 ocaml problems list, and attempting some of the Advent of Code 2021 problems.

All work contained in the ocaml.org file.
