# Learning OCaml

Working on learning about functional programming through `OCaml`, with a side goal of learning to use `org-mode` as a literate programming environment. Separate components of this project will be in separate `.org` files, intermittently exported to more legible pdfs.

- Going through the [CS3110 book](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html). Maybe taking some notes but doing the exercises.
- Working through the [99 OCaml Problems](https://ocaml.org/problems) (Now just called "problems")
- Working through some [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) problems. Starting with 2021.
- Maybe doing some PE questions. I know posting these solution is frowned upon, so I will add no exposition.
